# Getting started tutorial
{: #gettingStarted}

The {{site.data.keyword.speechtotextfull}} service transcribes audio to text to enable speech transcription capabilities for applications. This cURL-based tutorial can help you get started quickly with the service. The examples show you how to call the service's `POST /v1/recognize` method to request a transcript.
{: shortdesc}

> **Important:** The tutorial uses service instance credentials to authenticate to the {{site.data.keyword.speechtotextshort}} service. In some regions, new service instances instead use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authentication. Authenticate by using the approach that is right for your region and service instance.

For more information about where and how the service uses IAM authentication, see the [Release notes](/docs/services/speech-to-text/release-notes.html).

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin}

- {: download} If you're seeing this text, you created your service instance. Now get your credentials.
- Create an instance of the service:
    1.  Go to the [{{site.data.keyword.speechtotextshort}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.{DomainName}/catalog/services/speech-to-text){: new_window} page in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Catalog.
    1.  Sign up for a free {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account or log in.
    1.  Click **Create**.
- Copy the credentials to authenticate to your service instance:
    1.  On the service dashboard, click the **Service credentials** tab.
    1.  Click **View credentials** under **Actions**.
    1.  Copy the `username`, `password`, and `url` values.
- Make sure that you have cURL:
    - The examples use cURL to call methods of the HTTP interface. Install the version for your operating system from [curl.haxx.se ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://curl.haxx.se/){: new_window}. Install the version that supports the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Make sure to include the installed binary file on your `PATH` environment variable.

## Step 1: Transcribe audio with no options
{: #transcribe}

Call the `POST /v1/recognize` method to request a basic transcript of a FLAC audio file with no additional request parameters.

1.  Download the sample audio file <a target="_blank" href="https://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/doc-tutorial-downloads/speech-to-text/audio-file.flac" download="audio-file.flac">audio-file.flac <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon" title="External link icon" class="style-scope doc-content"></a>.
1.  Issue the following command to call the service's `/v1/recognize` method for basic transcription with no parameters. The example uses the `Content-Type` header to indicate the type of the audio, `audio/flac`. The example uses the default language model, `en-US_BroadbandModel`, for transcription.
    -   Replace `{username}` and `{password}` with your service credentials from the previous step.
    -   Modify `{path_to_file}` to specify the location of the `audio-file.flac` file.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -u {username}:{password} \
    --header "Content-Type: audio/flac" \
    --data-binary @{path_to_file}audio-file.flac \
    "https://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api/v1/recognize"
    ```
    {: pre}

    The service returns the following transcription results:

    ```javascript
    {
      "results": [
        {
          "alternatives": [
            {
              "confidence": 0.8691191673278809,
              "transcript": "several tornadoes touch down as a line of
severe thunderstorms swept through colorado on sunday "
            }
          ],
          "final": true
        }
      ],
      "result_index": 0
    }
    ```
    {: codeblock}

## Step 2: Transcribe audio with options
{: #transcribeOptions}

Call the `POST /v1/recognize` method to transcribe the same FLAC audio file, but specify two transcription parameters.

1.  If necessary, download the sample audio file <a target="_blank" href="https://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/doc-tutorial-downloads/speech-to-text/audio-file.flac" download="audio-file.flac">audio-file.flac <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon" title="External link icon" class="style-scope doc-content"></a>.
1.  Issue the following command to call the service's `/v1/recognize` method with two extra parameters. Set the `timestamps` parameter to `true` to indicate the beginning and end of each word in the audio stream. Set the `max_alternatives` parameter to `3` to receive the three most likely alternatives for the transcription. The example uses the `Content-Type` header to indicate the type of the audio, `audio/flac`, and the request uses the default model, `en-US_BroadbandModel`.
    -   Replace `{username}` and `{password}` with your service credentials.
    -   Modify `{path_to_file}` to specify the location of the `audio-file.flac` file.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -u {username}:{password} \
    --header "Content-Type: audio/flac" \
    --data-binary @{path_to_file}audio-file.flac \
    "https://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api/v1/recognize?timestamps=true&max_alternatives=3"
    ```
    {: pre}

    The service returns the following results, which include timestamps and three alternative transcriptions:

    ```javascript
    {
      "results": [
        {
          "alternatives": [
            {
              "timestamps": [
                ["several":, 1.0, 1.51],
                ["tornadoes":, 1.51, 2.15],
                ["touch":, 2.15, 2.5],
                . . .
              ]
            },
            {
              "confidence": 0.8691191673278809,
              "transcript": "several tornadoes touch down as a line
of severe thunderstorms swept through colorado on sunday "
            },
            {
              "transcript": "several tornadoes touched down as a line
of severe thunderstorms swept through colorado on sunday "
            },
            {
              "transcript": "several tornadoes touch down is a line
of severe thunderstorms swept through colorado on sunday "
            }
          ],
          "final": true
        }
      ],
      "result_index": 0
    }
    ```
    {: codeblock}
